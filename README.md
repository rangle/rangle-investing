## Objectives

We started Rangle Investing to use as a starter project to get new Ranglers on board how Rangle works, in terms of the following:

1. Become familiar with Angular development 

Apps are better than tutorials because they provide context and an opportunity to reinforce concepts through your own code. 

2. Become familiar with Rangle's internal processes

While we're starting out working in a fairly ad hoc fashion, this project can easily be used as a sample project to familiarize ourselves with Rangle's processes, such as a `rebase`-based git flow, clarity canvas, stories, standups, etc. 

3. Become familiar with your future teammates

Despite a strong process-based culture, everyone works differently, and it's nice to have a sample project to get acquainted with (and hopefully reconcile) those differences to reduce potential conflicts in a real project.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

To run the app from a different port, please run `ng serve --port <port_number>`.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`. 

This can also be shortened to `ng g <scaffold-item> <item-name>`. 

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Linting

Navigate to your **directory root** first and then run `ng lint`. 

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
